# video_game_analysis

This data analysis project aims to answer the question:
Are there specific words used in video game descriptions that significantly increase or decrease sales?

This analysis uses two video game data sets:

"Top Video Games 1995-2021 Metacritic" 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/top-video-games-19952021-metacritic

"Video Game Sales"
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

cleaning.ipynb - merges the two data sets and cleans up the summaries

EDA.ipynb - exploratory data analysis to visualize the data

Analyses.ipynb - finds the most frequently used words in the game summaries and performs a significance test on each to determine if mean global sales are significantly different when the word is in the description and when it is not.
